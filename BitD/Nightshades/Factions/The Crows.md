Our reputation with the Crows started off on the wrong beak, as we stole a gondola from them and  started doing business in their territory without giving them a cut. The previous leader, Rorick, died somehow leaving a power vacuum which Lyssa is trying to fill. Rumors say she was responsible for his death.

Leader - Lyssa
Second in Command - [[Bell]]
