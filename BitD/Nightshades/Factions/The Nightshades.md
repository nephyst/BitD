They started getting the attention of [[The Bluecoats]] when a small drug deal to college professors made too much noise ([[1 - Burnout]]), butthe crew has been good about covering their tracks and staying quiet. 

The crew expanded their territory by adding [[3 - The Dockhouse]]. The news spread quickly because they got it for an incredibly low price from [[The Red Sashes]] after they got scared off by a ghost, [[Kamelin]]. The rumors excluded the fact that the crew was responsible for [[Kamelin]] showing up.
