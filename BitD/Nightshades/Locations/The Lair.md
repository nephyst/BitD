An abandoned brothel in severe disrepair, only accessible via gondola. Located on the river across from Fogcrest.

The crew's starting hunting grounds is the southwest island in Crow's Foot.

The Foundation helped repair and clean up the boat house and quarters as part of an academic project.

A gondola stolen from the blue coats sits in the boathouse. It was repainted to fit in with the local style and to not be recognizable.
