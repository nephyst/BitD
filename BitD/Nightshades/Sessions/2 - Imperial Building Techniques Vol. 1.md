The Professor asked the Crew to obtain a good quality copy of the Imperial Building Techiques Vol 1 from [[The Foghounds]]. He provided a warehouse where he expected the book to be found.

The crew decided to go in stealth, finding a ladder around back and using it to climb onto the roof to entered through an open window. They drug the ladder onto the roof to cover thier tracks and prevent anyone from following. The crew climbed onto some rafters to get an overview of the warehouse and scout possible locations for the book.

There are a few sets of guards patrolling between the shelves, putting the crew into a risky position. While trying to get a glimpse of the guard's patrol patterns, Nyx knocked over a tin getting the attention of one of the guards.

Sid jumped softly onto a platform down below, but miss judged it due to the darkness. He caught himself with a parkour roll, taking two stress.

Tael spotted a crate hanging in the air, but the controller is accross the room and it would take some effort to get there. The create had a seal indicating they were from [[Ilysia]], the city of Engineering. Grey, while hunting, finds a section of the warehouse that has more creates with the same seal and sends his seagull to let Sid know.

Tael made his way over to the mechamism controlling the suspended create, while Sid used his disguise kit to fit in with the guards patrolling the warehouse.

Sid swayed two warehouse workers to help locate the book, using documents the framed [[Bell]]. The worker notes Bells name in the ledger, while Sid makes sure not to leave the documentation behind since it was forged. Sid mesmerised them making them forget he asked for help, making them think they offered to help.

One of the dock workers triggered some trap that caused tendrils of pink mist to slide out out of their face holes. Tael released the break causing the suspended crate to fall, crashing to the ground. While the other dock worker is distracted, Sid makes his way to a spot that looks eaiser to climb up from. Nyx set up climbing gear to help Sid climb back up. Grey pulled out Electroplasmic ammunition and shot the tentacle demon in the face. Sid makes it back up to the rafters, and the crew disappears into the night. Some blue coats got a glimpse of them fleeing the scene, but couldn't figure out where they went.

The [[The Bluecoats]] interviewed [[Debbie White]], our physicker, but she didn't have any information on our crimes.

## Downtime

Grey finished tracking down basic alchemical tools that will help us start experimenting. Sid went on a bender and lost the game some rep. The crew reduced it's heat a bit.
