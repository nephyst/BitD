[[Sid Sage]] disappeared with the cube, and [[Nyx Smoak]] is pretty sure he's on another bender. Nyx and [[Teal Templeton]] head to Barrowcleft to see if he's visited his powder dealer, but they claimed they haven't seen him. Teal noticed a kid near by and pointed them out to Nyx. Nyx tips the powder dealer, and calls out to the kid who starts running. Nyx offers payment and the kid accepts and says she knows where the man with the cube went. Nyx ups the payment and throws in a candy and she agrees to lead them to where Sid went. Nyx purchases shoes for her on the way there, and points out a small window near the top where she saw [[Sid Sage]].

[[Teal Templeton]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] knock on the door and a lady answers, but she tells them that window is fake and doesn't go to her house. They thank her and look for a way up, finding an escape ladder on the building next to them. They climb up and jump over to the other building. They find [[Miriam Blackwood]], and explain they are members of [[The Nightshades]]. "I need to right the wrong, I need to get back in the family", and he had some weird cube. [[Nyx Smoak]] explains what happened with the cube, and that [[Sid Sage]] is now missing with it. [[Miriam Blackwood]] thinks he might have gone to someone he knew in Charhollow.

On the way they get stopped by [[Bad Penny]], who claims to know [[Grey Dunvil]]. [[Miriam Blackwood]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] really don't trust Penny. To get past the trust issues quickly Miriam enters into a Ghost Contract with Penny, and then quickly leads the crew. [[Sid Sage]] had told [[Miriam Blackwood]] to come here and use a secret knock if he was ever in trouble, and this was the first time that had happened. [[Nara Jayan]] opens the door and lets them in after Miriam explains that they are there because Sid is in trouble. Nara explains she is a printer, and her late husband [[Jarnivan Jayan]] was a professor. Nara thinks that if Sid was trying to rejoin his family he would probably go to the consulate. [[Miriam Blackwood]] knows that would likely end in his father finding out he's still alive, which could be catastrophic.

The crew arrives near the consulate. The building and surrounding gate are made of dark stone. There are guards in military out front, but there is no sign of [[Sid Sage]]. [[Nyx Smoak]] tries to sway the guards into revealing if they have seen [[Sid Sage]] recently, but doesn't have any success.

The crew pops into a nearby alley way, and [[Nyx Smoak]] attempts to ask any nearby ghosts if they had seen [[Sid Sage]] recently. The spirit reveals [[Sid Sage]] turned himself in for murder and is getting sent away on a boat.

[[Miriam Blackwood]] explains that [[Sid Sage]] was framed by someone very powerful in his family, the Templetons. [[Teal Templeton]] spits out a mouthful of water upon hearing the name. [[Nyx Smoak]] takes the crew to [[Brightstone]] to visit her uncle [[Karim Smoak]].  [[Nyx Smoak]] explains the situation to her uncle and asks for help. [[Karim Smoak]] says he has heard of the murder and that there is an Iruvian ship docked in [[Silkshore]]. [[Miriam Blackwood]] asks if he knows when [[Sid Sage]] will be transferred, and [[Miriam Blackwood]] offers some of her future profits from the crew's [[Go-Glo]] business as payment. [[Karim Smoak]] finds out when the prisoner transfer is going to happen and the crew plans a heist!

The crew sets up a series of visually stunning explosions that force the carriage to divert into a nearby alley, where the crew had prepared a trap. [[Miriam Blackwood]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] drop down from above and take out the driver and passenger at the front without using lethal force. [[Teal Templeton]] tries to release one of the goats to help distract the remaining guards, but gets kicked in the shin causing some serious pain. [[Bad Penny]] works with the gang's thugs and takes out a third guard. The last guard tries to jump [[Nyx Smoak]], but she pulls a ghost from somewhere that chases the guard off. The ghost helps unlock the carriage and [[Miriam Blackwood]] opens the door.

A guard inside points his sword at the prisoner as Miriam asks if he wants to do this the hard way. Miriam distracts the guard by pointing to the corner. As soon as the guard turns, Miriam uses a vial of slumber essence to put him to sleep. [[Miriam Blackwood]] uncovers [[Sid Sage]]'s face, finding him unconscious, and carries him to the getaway carriage. [[Nyx Smoak]] helps [[Teal Templeton]] hobble over. [[Nyx Smoak]] uses smelling salts to wake [[Sid Sage]] up and tells him he needs to drive.

[[Teal Templeton]] gives the goats some [[Go-Glo]] and their eyes turn green as they take off down the alley. [[Sid Sage]] barely manages to keep control as it whips through the town. [[Nyx Smoak]] attunes to the goats, showing hands coming from the goats pushing them along while more hands come down from the sky petting the goats heads. The arms pet [[Nyx Smoak]] as she feels the air temperature drop around her. The clouds lower and turn a spectral green color. [[Nyx Smoak]] glances over at [[Miriam Blackwood]] with a comfortable terrified look, and [[Miriam Blackwood]] returns the same expression with a little added confusion.
