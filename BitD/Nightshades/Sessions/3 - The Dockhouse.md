The crew wanted to expand to a new hunting ground in the Docks. [[The Red Sashes]] have a small dockhouse in the Docks. [[The Lampblacks]] are currently at war with the Red Sashes, and the Crew thought [[Bazso Baz]] might be interested in making a deal with us to take some territory off their enemies hands.

After a dubious encounter with the second in command, the Nighshades convinced [[Pickett]] to grant them a meeting with [[Bazso Baz]]. Bazso agreed to pay us 2 coins up front and to let us keep the dockhouse, as long as we repaid him 1 coin on each of the next 2 jobs. Bazso took care of bribing [[The Bluecoats]] so they would avoid that part of the docks on their patrols.

[[Nyx Smoak]] summoned a demon friend, [[Satara]], and asked it for advice on how we can scare [[The Red Sashes]]. The demon agreed on the condition that it was given a small section of the werehouse for a nest. Nyx agreed and the demon suggested they contact Kamelin, a recently deceased member of [[The Lampblacks]] that has a grudge against [[The Red Sashes]]. To do this the crew needs Kamelin's belt buckle which is floating in the water between [[The Dockhouse]] and a boat. [[Sid Sage]] and [[Grey Dunvil]] decided to go together to collect it, while [[Tael Templeton]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] finish setting up the ritual.
