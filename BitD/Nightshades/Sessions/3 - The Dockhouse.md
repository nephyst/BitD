The crew wanted to expand to a new hunting ground in the Docks. [[The Red Sashes]] have a small dockhouse in the Docks. [[The Lampblacks]] are currently at war with the Red Sashes, and the Crew thought [[Bazso Baz]] might be interested in making a deal with us to take some territory off their enemies hands.

After a dubious encounter with the second in command, the Nighshades convinced [[Pickett]] to grant them a meeting with [[Bazso Baz]]. Bazso agreed to pay us 2 coins up front and to let us keep the dockhouse, as long as we repaid him 1 coin on each of the next 2 jobs. Bazso took care of bribing [[The Bluecoats]] so they would avoid that part of the docks on their patrols.

[[Nyx Smoak]] summoned a demon friend, [[Satara]], and asked it for advice on how we can scare [[The Red Sashes]]. The demon agreed on the condition that it was given a small section of the werehouse for a nest. Nyx agreed and the demon suggested they contact Kamelin, a recently deceased member of [[The Lampblacks]] that has a grudge against [[The Red Sashes]]. To do this the crew needs Kamelin's belt buckle which is floating in the water between [[The Dockhouse]] and a boat. [[Sid Sage]] and [[Tesslyn Comber]] decided to go together to collect it, while [[Teal Templeton]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] finish setting up the ritual.

[[Sid Sage]] and [[Tesslyn Comber]] rowed to the dockhouse and saw a corpse in a difficult to reach spot. Sid boosted Tesslyn up into a sewer outlet at the end of the dockhouse. Just as Breanna's cat fountain exploded water all over the place, an ectoplasmic explosion blasts [[Tesslyn Comber]] into the water next to the body. Sid pulled out a harmonica to distract a passing blue coat vessel, aided by the dockworker disguise he was wearing. Sid helped Tess into the boat and secured the buckle while offering a towel.

The crew met up at a shed near the Dockhouse. [[Teal Templeton]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] prepped for the ritual while trying to avoid being detected, which was somewhat difficult as the process created a lot of smoke that carried a noticable but plesant smell. Nyx performs the ritual with the burnt herbs and the belt buckle.

As [[Kamelin]] appears [[Tesslyn Comber]] ran outside; [[Teal Templeton]] froze behind some boxes; [[Sid Sage]] resisted the ghostly presence; and [[Nyx Smoak]] calmly negotiated. [[Kamelin]] asked the crew to kill [[The Red Sashes]]'s whisperer in return, but [[Nyx Smoak]] declined. [[Kamelin]] agreed to help anyway, scaring away [[The Red Sashes]]'s crew. The Sashes wanted to get rid of the problem quickly, selling it to us for only 1 coin. When word got around about them abandoning it they got angry and accused us for taking advantage of them.

## Downtime

[[Sid Sage]] started a long term project to get a demon flatigator as a house pet. [[Tesslyn Comber]] started the process to hire a physicker for the crew.
