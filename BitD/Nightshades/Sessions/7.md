[[Nyx Smoak]] and [[Sid Sage]] meet with [[Karim Smoak]] in a private room in a tea shop. Nyx Smoak introduces Sid, and Karim notes the explosions required to rescue him. Everyone sits, and Sid asks if he is familiar with the missing artifact that was taken from him. Karim Smoak said it was scheduled to be moved to the ship that held Sid, but currently resides in [[Elstera Avrathi]]'s office. It seems [[The Circle of Flame]] has an interest in it.

[[Sid Sage]] goes to take a sip of tea, and notices the tea cup flash in a similar way to the mirrored cube. Sid throws the cup into the wall smashing into, and then apologies profusely. [[Karim Smoak]] asks if he needed more tea, and Sid declines saying he should should probably call it good for the moment.

[[Nyx Smoak]] asks [[Karim Smoak]] if he has heard [[The Giants]], and he explains it's a guiding entity trying to reshape the world as it sees fit. It's not as exciting as a demon, and the legends suggest its more of a keeper or guider and doesn't have much of a following.

[[Sid Sage]] asks [[Miriam Blackwood]] about [[The Circle of Flame]] and [[Elstera Avrathi]]. Miriam knows of them, but doesn't think it's a good idea to bring this to them as it's pretty far above their pay grade. They meet at [[The Centuralia Club]], and often use demons and other nefarious means to gain power.

The crew decides to plan a heist to collect the cube from [[Elstera Avrathi]]'s office. [[Miriam Blackwood]] reveals they have a masquerade on the third Monday of every month. They decide to disguises and invitations for a deception heist.
