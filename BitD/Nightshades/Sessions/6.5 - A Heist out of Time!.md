Miriam picks up blueprints of a friend who also belongs to [[The Circle of Flame]], Augus. They show a secret safe that [[Bell]] hired Augus to install recently into the Phantom Gambling Den. The den is located in the basement of a theater in [[The Crows Foot]].

The surface level is a rundown theater that plays films for the local working class. In the floor below there's a gambling area up front, with a store house in the back where they handle the money. Further back down an L shaped hallway is the office.

Miriam uses their cover identify Jack Peaches, a dock foreman. Penny dresses up as a service worker brining in kegs of beer, while Nyx hides inside one of the kegs.

Before the Heist, Miriam surveys the location and watches for someone delivering kegs. Miriam follows them and thinks they came from Catfish Aleworks.

Miriam, playing as Jack, slips a couple of aces into the pockets of the player next to them. On their next winning hand Jack causes a distraction by accusing them of cheating, pointing out the aces.

Penny on the way in notices the kegs they got were actually branded Full Moon Brewers, but security lets them in anyway as they quickly turn to the distraction in the lobby. As soon as they get to the back room Penny lets Nyx out of the keg.

Ruby compels a spirit from the ghost field to assist using a chant from her heritage. A lanky spirit in a dress suit with a vest is pulled from the gambling area. It's pockets are full of cards and dice, and it is sporting a bowler hat with cards sticking out. They are willing to help with what you need, but there's going to be payment owed down the line. Nyx accepts the deal. The spirit seems to know what Nyx needs, and Nyx understands the attunement needs to be maintained.

The guy that Miriam accused on cheating was thrown out by security, and Miriam notices the guard at the door disappeared. The guard approaches Penny and says the boss didn't order any Catfish Aleworks, and asks them to explain what they are doing there.

Miriam stands up from the table and heads towards the bathroom, planning on sneaking into the backroom to help with the heist.

Penny tries using the powder on one of them, but fumbles it and gets bashed in the chest. Penny shoots him in the knee, and just after Miriam enters and prowls behind the other and chokes him until he is unconscious. The crew knocks the first guard out and patches up his knee, before tying them up in the corner.

The spirit shows up with a few coins, and leaves with a few more in it's pockets. It also drops a very [[distinct dagger]]. A black dagger with gold accents and a crows head on the pommel; it has seen some use.

The crew heads for a vent in the back they noticed in the blueprints, and makes their way to an escape boat. The Physicker the crew was trying to hire ends up getting an exclusive contract with the crows, setting back the clock two ticks. They do give the name of another physicker named Arib Chafik that we could try contacting.

[[Debbie White]] got some heat from [[The Crows]] and decided to stop working with [[The Nightshades]]

During downtime, Miriam pulls down a bunch of wanted posters for [[Bad Penny]] around [[The Crows Foot]] and burns them in a ritual with members from [[The Circle of Flame]]. Afterwords, Miriam consorts with Ojack to help move the flatigator acquisition along. [[Nyx Smoak]] meets with [[Arib Chafik]] to convince them to join [[The Nightshades]]. With a couple coins in hand [[Arib Chafik]] agrees.
