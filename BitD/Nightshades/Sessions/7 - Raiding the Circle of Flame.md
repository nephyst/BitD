[[Nyx Smoak]] and [[Sid Sage]] meet with [[Karim Smoak]] in a private room in a tea shop. Nyx Smoak introduces Sid, and Karim notes the explosions required to rescue him. Everyone sits, and Sid asks if he is familiar with the missing artifact that was taken from him. Karim Smoak said it was scheduled to be moved to the ship that held Sid, but currently resides in [[Elstera Avrathi]]'s office. It seems [[The Circle of Flame]] has an interest in it.

[[Sid Sage]] goes to take a sip of tea, and notices the tea cup flash in a similar way to the mirrored cube. Sid throws the cup into the wall smashing into, and then apologies profusely. [[Karim Smoak]] asks if he needed more tea, and Sid declines saying he should should probably call it good for the moment.

[[Nyx Smoak]] asks [[Karim Smoak]] if he has heard [[The Giants]], and he explains it's a guiding entity trying to reshape the world as it sees fit. It's not as exciting as a demon, and the legends suggest its more of a keeper or guider and doesn't have much of a following.

[[Sid Sage]] asks [[Miriam Blackwood]] about [[The Circle of Flame]] and [[Elstera Avrathi]]. Miriam knows of them, but doesn't think it's a good idea to bring this to them as it's pretty far above their pay grade. They meet at [[The Centuralia Club]], and often use demons and other nefarious means to gain power.

The crew decides to plan a heist to collect the cube from [[Elstera Avrathi]]'s office. [[Miriam Blackwood]] reveals they have a masquerade on the third Monday of every month. They decide to disguise as guests, and use Karim's invitation to forge their own.

Nyx, Miriam, [[Mr. Brick]], and [[Bad Penny]] approach the party in their disguises and present the invitations. The guards step back and start checking the guest list. Nyx name drops her uncle Karim, and complains that this is taking too long, and asks Mr. Brick to resolve the situation. Mr. Brick steps up and commands them to allow us to pass. The guards allow them to pass, but the guards make note of the group.

The crew makes their way inside. An orchestra plays while servants pass out refreshments. Everyone spreads out to prod for weaknesses. The direct route is heavily guarded, but the crew noticed a path that leads out of the way but should get them closer to the office. The guard is clearly falling asleep.

Miriam moves up close to the guard and blows slumber essence towards him. Miriam makes sure he stays propped up as he slumps over. Mr. Brick and Penny follow Miriam through the door, after waiting a few minutes to draw attention away.

Mr. Brick approaches a janitor and commands them to tell us the layout of the back offices. The janitor agrees and guides them to a shortcut that leads the crew to the office. Penny ties to loot the area, but ends up breaking a clearly valuable pot made by someone's child. 

Mr. Brick grabs the door handle, but Miriam attunes to the glowing mechanism on the door that the crew totally expected and quickly stops him.

[[Flashback]] to [[Nyx Smoak]] and [[Sid Sage]] visit [[Ojak]] to try and procure a mechanism to let the crew communicate while not being in the same space. Ojak offers a discount of just 2 coins for a higher quality devise. The crew gains access to sending stones. The sending stone allows the user to communicate a whispered message to every crew members by taking 1 stress and 1 loadout.

At the same moment that Mr. Brick grabs the door handle, [[Nyx Smoak]] broadcasts a message to the crew saying "What the hell is going on?". [[Mr. Brick]] pulls out his stone and responds asking for Nyx to join them.

[[Nyx Smoak]] shows up a couple minutes later, and quickly attunes to the trap wedged in the door frame. Nyx realizes the trap has already been set off, and in a panic asks how long ago it was sprung. In response Mr. Brick kicks the door down, and shrugs. Nyx, also in a panic, compels a ghost - but only manages to summon a very small spirit. [[Nyx Smoak]] asks the spirit to try and scare anyone else to shows up away.

Mr. Brick keeps the crew moving quickly, and surveys the area as the crew progresses; taking a devils bargain involving a future desire for the cube. The only people in the area were some diplomats working on some deal. Mr. Brick tips his hat and closes the door, and stands guard with a fine pair of brass knuckle gloves.

One of the diplomats tries to leave the room. Mr. Brick catches the door and explains the area is currently restricted and closes the door. Nyx, Miriam, and Penny enter the office. The office is large and contains an area with a desk and paperwork. Nyx tries to attune to the cube to discern it's location. Miriam and Penny survey for anything they can find about The Circle of Flame. 

Three people, including the Chief Diplomat [[Elstera Avrathi]], enter through the main doorway and are heading towards their office. He grabs a manacle and chain and locks the door behind him, and quickly uses a sending stone to alert the crew.

Penny heads towards the door to help Mr. Brick, while Miriam helps Nyx with the mirrored cube. Elstera approaches Mr. Brick and asks him to move aside. He nods and allows them to pass, while Penny waits on the other side of the office door. After a few failed attempts, Miriam pulls out a pistol and opens the case holding the cube.

Penny shoots at the guard, and hits their knee but fails to slow them down. Nyx takes a blank devils bargain to set up climbing gear and make a quick getaway. Mr. Brick pulls a gun on the diplomat and tells her companions to step aside. The crew follows Nyx out the window.

As the crew is closing out the score, the Talons show up with a few extra members but also a bit bruised up.
