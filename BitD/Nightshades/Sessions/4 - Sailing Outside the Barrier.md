The crew needs money in a bad way, also known as [[Bazso Baz]]. They get word of a job in the docks from [[Lydra]]. [[Teal Templeton]] threatens to burn down Lydra's office, but that wasn't enough to derail the job.

The crew heads to The Old Forge Tavern which is owned by their contact [[Ulf Ironborn]], leader of [[The Ironborn Crew]]. [[Sid Sage]] walked into the room with an overly friendly demeanor and narwly dodged a dagger flying by his face, garnering praise from the crowd. The dagger was thrown by Havid, second in command of the Ironborn.

Sid offers to pay for the next round of drinks. Ulf asks why he should trust them. Sid mentions the last job with the ghost, and explains that the crew is up for challenges and is good at problem solving and finding solutions others have missed. Ulf explains that the job would involve going into the void sea. Ulf would pay them 8 coins, 6 of which would have to be delivered to a contact. The crew asks for 3 and Ulf agrees. Ulf also includes a boat that is a bit more seaworthy, and explains that the contact will know the secret phrase "The owl's beak".

The crew meets with a professor to learns to run the boat silently if any leviathans show up, but the job is still going to be pretty dangerous. [[Sid Sage]], [[Teal Templeton]], and [[Nyx Smoak]] set sail with 6 coin on the boat Ulf provided and makes it out of the harbor without incident.

Sid's sea shanty attracts the attention of something nearby. Noticing this, Sid shuts down the engine and turns the lights off.

A woman happens to be hiding next to Sid says "Oh, what are we hiding from?" Sid responds as if this was totally normal and explains about the leviathan. The woman claimed responsibility for saving them from the creature.

She asks if Ulf was with us, and we explained we are working for him. Sid asks how we can trust her, and she responds by telling them to check their pockets. They each find an owl's beak and she reveals herself to be Madam Silvia. They make the deal, and Silvia provides some vague guidance. The crew discussed their goals of taking control of the city, and leading an army of demons and ghosts.

The lanterns on the boat glared blindlinly bright for a moment before settling down to a normal level. The flash catches the attention of a creature in the water. Luckily [[Teal Templeton]] was prepared for this, having a supply of [[Go-Glo]]. Injecting it into the engine allowed them to outrun the creature. 

[[Teal Templeton]] tinkered with the engine keeping it running at the increased pace without any issues, but [[Sid Sage]] is unable to maintain control of the boat at that speed and almost crashes. [[Nyx Smoak]] tuned into the spectual plane and watched with abject terror as giant spectral hands and claws in the water and air are grasping at the boat.

Tael studied the box before we turned it over to [[Ulf Ironborn]]. It had no identifiable markings, and appears to be in pristene condition which is intriguing. The crew decides not to open it, and hand it over.

The crew pays [[Bazso Baz]] 1 of the 2 coins owed to him by the crew, and pays 1 coin to [[The Hive]] who run the docks. The workers at the dockhouse opened the wrong package, losing the gang a reputation and angering The Siphers. The crew works with the workers to improve the quality of the operations.

Sid and Nyx go together to meet the demon flaitgator smugler [[Ojak]] to check them out and to negotiate a trade. Tael experimented with his new drug. The crew hired a gang of thugs, called The Talons.
