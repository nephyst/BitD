A mysterious figure appears at the chess table inside the locked vault. [[Chantry Brikk]] pulls out a gun as [[Sid Sage]] asks if he can help them. The figure claims they have shared friends and introduces themselves as [[Adikin]]. [[Sid Sage]] can tell [[Adikin]] is telling the truth and tells the crew as such and asks them to put away their weapons.

[[Adikin]] produces a magical mote of energy onto [[Nyx Smoak]]'s hands, which dissolves into a warm and fuzzy feeling. [[Nyx Smoak]], feeling uneasy, resists the urge to wipe her hands on her dress. A golden idol in the [[White Crown Gallery]] vault, which is located on an island. [[Adikin]] also knows of some locals who were recently arrested and might be looking to join up, as well as some local plots that are available for taking.

The crew approaches the front of the museum with [[Sid Sage]] in a fine disguise as Cid Cage, a wealthy noble adventurer from [[Iruvia]]. The crew makes there way through the museum, with Cid going heavy into the annoying noble role. After a tour of the building they end up on the top floor, meeting with an antiquarian.

[[Chantry Brikk]], going as Mr. Clay, places the box on the table in front of the antiquarian. [[Nyx Smoak]] unlocks the box, and presents the skull inside. The crew had not actually seen the artifact until this point, and as Nyx places its down it starts to bleed. [[Sid Sage]] claims the artifact is from [[Iruvia]], but the antiquarian is confused because that species has never been found on that continent. Sid is so convincing that the antiquarian requests additional scrutiny. [[Chantry Brikk]] places the skull back in the box, and says "Let's move this to the vault".

Everyone makes their way to the vault. As the antiquarian opens the vault [[Chantry Brikk]] tries to watch, but quickly notices one of the guards was watching him. [[Nyx Smoak]] quickly gives [[Chantry Brikk]] a kiss on the cheek to help diffuse the situation. The guard gives [[Chantry Brikk]] a nod of respect.

The crew, knowing they would make it into the vault, had planned for the [[Talons]] to stage a diversion. Blaming [[Sid Sage]]'s recklessness, [[Chantry Brikk]] asks them to attack the first floor with a loud explosion and to be ready with a getaway boat. [[Chantry Brikk]] gets triggered and goes absolutely ham on all the guards, but managed to not kill any of them. [[Teal Templeton]] takes a few guards out with blow darts. [[Nyx Smoak]] uses the distraction to set up climbing gear. They make there way to the boat.

On the way, the crew attracts the attention of a goul that demands they murder someone before they will locate any more artifacts for [[The Custodians]]. The crew refuses, and spends the night running and killing gouls.

Back at the lair [[Adikin]] provides 12 coin for the idol. [[Sid Sage]] notices the idol move. He convinces [[Adikin]] to hand it back and Sid tries to attune to it. Nothing seems to happen at first, but then the sound of metal grinding echoes from the idol and it says "Leopold Templeton, disowned by his family and accused of murder".

[[Teal Templeton]] visited [[Ojak]] and discussed some of the ritual, and finished distributing drugs for 2 coins.

[[Chantry Brikk]] attempted to indulge his vice, but struggled to a deep wound, and afterwards visited [[Arib Chafik]] to tend to his wounds. Frustrated at his failed attempt to relieve stress, he goes back to activities he is more ashamed of and has more success.

[[Nyx Smoak]] communed at the altar to get guidance, and was provided a portrait and a symbol with three circles, one which represented group gathering. She went to talk to her uncle [[Karim Smoak]] and told him of what she experienced in the portal, in [[10 - Through the portal]] and convinced him to join the cult, progressing the [[Regroup]] goal.

[[Sid Sage]] heals his level 1 harms and trains a bit.
