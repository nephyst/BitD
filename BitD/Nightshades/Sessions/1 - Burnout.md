## The Drug Deal

We got in contact with a small time drug runner in `Crow's Foot` named [[Bazso Baz]]. He gave us a job to move some `Burnout`, a drug that boosts memory short term memory. Sid and Teal used their connection to to [[Professor Edward Hornsby]] at the [[Charterhall University]] University to sell to professors, and potentially students.

Flashback: We prepped samples of the drug and small gift bags to give out to the party.

A couple of `bluecoats` arrived. Sid answered the door and fumbled over his words drawing suspicious on the party, starting a suspicion clock.

Nyx stayed outside and kept watch for [[The Bluecoats]], or any other suspicious activity.

A student at the party passed out. Sid and tael acted quickly, drawing the party goers into another part of the hosue where Sid put on a show using trick cards and dice. Sid sampled some Burnout and gave a performance that wowed the potential customers.

Grey, who was given an invitation to the party by Professor Hornsby, showed up right as the student was passing out and helped Tesslyn bring him into the bathroom. Tess was able to find a professor that deduced the student was having a reaction to peanuts, which were being servered from the kitchen that evening. The professor put together a paste for the student.

Sid took watch outside, allowing Nyx to re-enter the party. Nyx took a dose of the drug and did a performance where a ghost, `Isambard Vulompkis` - the original owner of the house, was Compelled to appear and then commanded them to give a show and reveal a hidden room in the mansion.

The performances and samples were enough to convince the party goers to purchase the entire supply of `Burnout`.

Grey met with the Professor, who offered 6 coin to collect the book `Imperial Building Techniques Vol. 1` in good condition. [[The Foghounds]] have the book in their collection. Grey, needing a crew for this heist, joins the Nightshades.

On the way back [[Bell]] from [[The Crows]] ambushed us and made us pay 1 coin as a tax for doing business in their territory.

## Downtime

Sid and Tess started to track down basic alchemical tools. Tael started researching ingredients for a new euphoric drug.
