The crew gets a letter from [[Mikaela Viitala]], a local noble, about a job. The letter asks the to meet at the Veil in the NightMarket to discuss the details. The crew goes to meet with her, and learns that the job is to open a vault and collect a necklace called the eye of the custodians. It has a large red ruby, and some say if you look deep into the ruby you can find something inside it.

Lady Viitalia offers 6 coins, and asks for her name to be left out of the operation. [[Nyx Smoak]] asks for 2 coins insurance in the scenario that the crew takes a reputation hit, or someone gets injured. Lady Viitalia has no interest in making any deals, and after fumbling the negotiation Nyx pleads to keep the 6 coin deal.

The vault is located in 6 towers, which formerly was a high class area but is now run down and largely abandoned. Nyx asks Ojak about the necklace, and finds out it belongs to a set of identical pieces and is somehow related to [[The Custodians]]. Ojack says he would pay 3 or 4 coin for one, and requests to look at it if the crew happens to find one.

[[Nyx Smoak]] goes to [[The Dockhouse]] and finds a quiet place to attempts attunement with the custodians. Nyx slices her palm with a dagger and covers it with her blood. A green hand reaches down to Nyx. Nyx gets on her knees and presents herself to the being. The being heals the cut on her palm, and cures her spectral stimulation wound. Nyx asks [[The Custodians]] what she should do about Lady Viitalia asking for one of their eyes. They seem generally okay with it happening, and want more eyes to be out there. Nyx feels like she has purpose.

[[Sid Sage]] checks the university archive for information about the building and nearby city block, but is only able to find a list of names.

[[Chantry Brikk]] goes to survey the location. The vault is located in a rundown manor that fits well into the nearby houses. A group called the [[Knotwork]] works out of this location. They are a resistance group from one of the last independent states to fall and join the [[Akorosi Empire]].

The crew wants to convince some of the Knotwork to go do another job for them, which would leave the mansion with fewer people to deal with. [[Chantry Brikk]] uses one of his contacts to find out a time and place where they could ambush the [[Captain Brace Lomond]], from the [[Six Towers]] [[The Bluecoats]]. On his way back, [[Chantry Brikk]] visits the Silver Swan pleasure barge to indulge his vice. 

[[Sid Sage]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] drop off a tip about the captain, and they say they will take care of it. They walk away and after a bit see a large group of people leaving the manor, seemingly to ambush the captain. They move around to the back. Mr Brikk uses a crowbar to smash the lock open, and the crew moves inside.

Sid quickly finds the necklace, picks it up, and looks a it. The spectral overstimulation that it took from [[Nyx Smoak]] earlier comes at [[Sid Sage]], but [[Chantry Brikk]] activates his Bodyguard trap card and blocks [[Sid Sage]] from taking any damage.

The crew opens another vault and finds a room where [[The Custodians]] seem highly attuned to. The crew takes some loot and goes back to the Lair to discuss. [[Nyx Smoak]] tells the crew she spoke to them, and [[Sid Sage]] backs her up since he also connected with them when he looked in the crystal. [[Chantry Brikk]] is very uncomfortable with all the weird spirit magic stuff and pours a few more drinks. [[Sid Sage]] loses his shit and leaves.

A few days later the crew meets up back at the club and hands over the necklace too  [[Mikaela Viitala]] for a payment of 8 coins. Before they handed it over they showed it to [[Ojak]] who identified it as an [[Eye of the Custodian]]. They paid 2 to [[The Crows]]. The [[Knotwork]] succeeded at ambushing [[Captain Brace Lomond]] and left him with severe injuries.
