[[Sid Sage]] licks a some frogs and loses his shit for a bit. [[Nyx Smoak]] studies from mushrooms. [[Chantry Brikk]] finds a stray dog and befriends it.

Sid, being high as balls, sees the dog walking on two legs and starts a conversation for it. The dog introduces itself as [[Sir Dog]], and tells of [[chaos minions]] that appeared recently at a nearby temple and offers to show Sid where it's at. The crew follows.

They run into the [[chaos minions]] just as Sid is asking [[Sir Dog]] about them, and they are not very friendly. Sid instinctively hides behind Chanty. [[Sir Dog]] tries to bit one of the minions, but gets injured. Sid jumps to defend [[Sir Dog]] with a spiritbane charm  commands them to 'Leave [[Sir Dog]] alone!''. The spirit lunges at [[Sid Sage]], but [[Chantry Brikk]] steps in and protects him for any damage.

Chantry swings a fine warhammer and connects with a few of them scattering them a bit. Nyx attunes to determine if they are demons, and tries to command them to flee which they do... but it seems like they regroup a small distance away. [[Teal Templeton]] hides behind [[Nyx Smoak]], and pulls out a wrench to threaten them.

One of the minions lunges at [[Teal Templeton]], and he successfully bashes one destroying it's mask. Dark misty smoke escapes from the broken mask. [[Nyx Smoak]] attunes and asks any nearby spirits to help, causing another minion to charge out of the forest nearby. A green hand trips it, saving Nyx from harm. [[Chantry Brikk]] smashes the mask of the last minon.

[[Sir Dog]], wincing in pain, finally answers [[Sid Sage]]'s question; "They look like that".

[[Chantry Brikk]] looks at [[Nyx Smoak]] and says, "You're the boss right? Sid is always high as balls, and Tael is making drugs that keep him high as balls...". [[Sid Sage]] doesn't even register the conversation.

[[Sid Sage]] discusses the situation with the dog, which no one else can hear, and he learns the minions showed up at the same time we did. [[Sir Dog]] explains that he needs to lead them to the temple, but isn't able to explain why.

It becomes clear that [[Nyx Smoak]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] don't believe that [[Sid Sage]] can talk to the dog, which convinces [[Sid Sage]] and [[Sir Dog]] are the only real people here.

[[Sir Dog]] leads the crew into the most amazing city any of the crew have ever seen, which seems to be populated with spirits that don't seem to notice the crew. [[Nyx Smoak]] picks up a fresh mango and takes a bite.

At the center of the village of a statue of Sid, Chantry, Tael and Nyx. The plaque says "The Heroes That Rebuilt The World". Upon reading it [[Sid Sage]] proclaims "I suppose I am something of a hero." [[Nyx Smoak]] looks closely at the statue and notices each statue has a symbol of two hands holding an eye.

[[Teal Templeton]] notices that this city looks like it was built ontop of the foundation of Duskvol, and leads the crew to where he expects water to be, which he is able to find. As soon as Tael tells the crew, [[Sid Sage]] suggests we should go to where [[Sanctuary]] is located.

[[Sir Dog]] leads the crew to the temple, and [[Nyx Smoak]] leads a ritual where she cuts the palms and draws blood from each of the crew. They hold hands and perform a ritual. [[Sid Sage]] says, "I trust you Nyx. I've always had your back and I know you've always had mine". The crew hears "repeat".

Everyone proclaims repeat, and then regroup, and then recover, and then regrow. A bowl appears, and everyone drips a few drops of blood into it. A weight is lifted off everyone, as the four of them become ordained members of [[The Keepers]], a new cult. A portal appears, brining the crew back to the real world.

[[Chantry Brikk]] takes [[Sid Sage]] to the [[Silver Swan]] and introduces him to [[Eldrin Prichard]], the purveyor of the establishment. [[Chantry Brikk]] introduces [[Sid Sage]] and explains that this is a safe place for him to indulge. [[Nyx Smoak]] visits [[Ojak]] and w
