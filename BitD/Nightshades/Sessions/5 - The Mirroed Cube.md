The crew needs a supply of Ectonide to craft a batch of [[Go-Glo]].

The crew visited [[Ojak]] in [[Silkshore]] and ask if he can supply ectonide, a key ingrediant that [[Teal Templeton]] needs to craft [[Go-Glo]]. Ojak offers a free 1/3 barrel of ectonide and 6 coins if the crew agrees to collect a mirrored-cube artifact from [[Deathwall Citadel]], which is located in the ghost plane.

[[Nyx Smoak]] takes Ojak aside privately. Nyx asks about the giant spectal hands she saw in [[4 - Sailing Outside the Barrier]]. Ojak explains that they are known as the giants, and suggests that Nyx should consider that maybe the spectual entities might be helping rather than hurting.

Nyx explains to the crew that we have to enter the ghost plane, which is going to be a miror of Duskvol, before using the ghost key to open the portal. The crew finds themselves at the giant oak doors marking the entrance to [[Deathwall Citadel]]. Located in a dry arid land, populated sparsely by dead trees. In the distance a wall of sparks marks Duskvol.

[[Sid Sage]], having spent some time researching this before hand, pulls out detailed maps that show a service entrance to the library next to a symbol of a red lock. After making their way there [[Teal Templeton]] opens the lock using fine lockpicks provided by [[Tesslyn Comber]]. Finding themselves in a morgue, they quickly realize the doors aren't taking them where they expected.

One of the bodies raises up. [[Nyx Smoak]] attunes and pleads that we are just looking for an artifact and we mean no harm. A body that [[Sid Sage]] was poking lifts it's arm and points to a newly opened door. Through the door is a ballroom where everything looks slightly green in a spectral sort of way. 

Accross the room are pairs of military uniformed figures without faces, dancing with ballroom dresses. [[Nyx Smoak]] notices one of them is missing a partner and walks up to it offering to dance. They bow in acceptance and the pair began to waltz. As they waft away, the ghost splits leaving another in it's place. [[Sid Sage]] and [[Teal Templeton]] follow suit, messing up their footing a bit here and there. I mean, dancing with ghosts is pretty weird. Nyx takes the mistakes pretty hard.

[[Sid Sage]] proclaims he finally understands the maps he brought, and explains the path to the vault is just on the otherside of the door.

After the dance the crew finds themselves on the other side of the room. Through the door is what looks like a commanders office. Three faceless figures stand still as if they are frozen in time. The figure at the desk is reaching over it with their hand in a curious position. Another is standing by a fireplace, with their hands stretched out towards the empty hearth. A woman in a dress pouring an empty tea kettle over a desk.

[[Sid Sage]], focusing on his maps, walks right into one of the frozen figures and stops for a second. [[Nyx Smoak]] cries out, causing Sid to jump out of the way.

[[Nyx Smoak]] looks around and notices that specific items are missing from each of the scenes. [[Sid Sage]] points out the pen, paper, fire, and tea are missing. [[Sid Sage]] puts one of his useless maps on the desk, and places a pen into the hand. The figures begins writing out a report relating to how the war is going. [[Teal Templeton]] uses something from his pouch to spark a chemical fire, and uses it to brew some leaves in the tea pot. The rest of the figures come to life, revealing a side door leading to the vault.

The crew finds themselves in an oak hallway with red carpet. The walls are lined with portraits of military heroes. The doors to the vault are wide open, revealing a marble room with a pedestal holding the mirrored cube. [[Sid Sage]] and [[Teal Templeton]] hold the vault doors open, with Teal jamming some swords to try and prevent them from moving. [[Tesslyn Comber]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] walk up and survey the cube. The cube seemed to reflect many images of battle and railroads.

Nyx moves back just outside the doors and attemps to compell a ghost to help gather the cube. A bunch of crazy shit happens resulting in an immense commander appearing and decaying into an abomination in the center of the room.

[[Sid Sage]] resists the presence of the commander and pulls a spirit bane charm. The commander fills the room with laughter and hucks a halberd at Sid, pinning him against the wall.
