[[Nyx Smoak]] asks [[Adikin]] for leads on where we can locate another [[Eye of the Custodian]] and they were able to provide a few locations:

[[Mikaela Viitala]] has one, that we sold to her in [[8 - The Custodians Revealed!]].
Another is located at the House of Palamas
A third is located in the ghost field, near the Lost district entrance.

[[Chantry Brikk]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] investigate the bluecoats jail where the cultists that have been arrested are being held. [[Nyx Smoak]] comes up with a plan to get [[Sid Sage]] thrown in jail to gain some insider information on the jail. [[Chantry Brikk]] disagrees, and instead Nyx tries to compel a ghost.

A small ghostly dog appears, and guides Nyx and Chantry through the market and eventually through a small window. Following the dog through the window, [[Nyx Smoak]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] finds themselves in the ghost plane. Nyx puts a mask on Chantry to protect him from any spirits. It becomes clear that the ghost dog is showing them another path to the prison.

[[Chantry Brikk]] and [[Sid Sage]] check out a bar the bluecoats frequent, and try to socialize with the clientele. Sid passes some coin to the bartender and asks if they know an in with the bluecoat clients. The bartender points to a group of three and says they keep to themselves mostly, but [[Bartram Brome]] seems to like a good game.

[[Chantry Brikk]] orders two of [[Bartram Brome]]'s favorite drinks and offers it up along with a game. The first rounds goes to Chantry. The second round [[Sid Sage]] wins with a loaded die, but after winning Sid admits to his trickery and hands up the false die. [[Sid Sage]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] ask if he can help them get the cultists out of prison. Bartram says that would have to go to the Captain of the Nightmarket, [[Abraham Pen]], who seems to have an interest in Exotic items such as rare pens.

On the way home [[Chantry Brikk]] asks [[Sid Sage]] if [[Nyx Smoak]] is seeing anyone. Sid Sage knowing that she is only interested in Chantry just replies, "And you think I am the biggest fool in the gang?". When they arrive home Nyx meets them at the door excitedly and helps put Chantry to bed.


We have a meeting with the captain of the Nighmarket.
There is a back door to the prison through a ghost door.
