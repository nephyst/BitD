[[Sid Sage]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] gather info about [[Sanctuary]]. They meet with Ninefingers of the [[Knotwork]]s and explain that the property has sentimental value to the crew without revealing the actual reason for their interest. Sid reveals that the previous tip they provided was an act of goodwill to gain enough favor to earn a meeting with them. We are also sympathetic to their cause, and if they aren't too attached to this specific property, we could provide assistance relocating to another abandoned property nearby and perhaps part with a few coin.

Ninefingers offers a job for the property. They need a shipment picked up from the bluecoats at the docks. The contact is Sgt. Donovan, who manages shipment logistics for weapons and inmates. The payment of 8 coins will be at the usual spot. Mr. Brikk's intuition indicates this isn't a setup.

The crew goes to investigate. As they approach the area [[Chantry Brikk]] goes up to the first bluecoat in the area and says he is here to rob them. [[Nyx Smoak]] quickly covers for him and leads him out of the area to a nearby bar. A ghost child sits in the corner, only visible to [[Nyx Smoak]] who smiles. Nyx and Mr. Brikk share a moment over his previous outburst.

[[Sid Sage]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] go to meet with the Sgt, while [[Teal Templeton]] and [[Chantry Brikk]] wait near by with a cart. Part way up the dock Nyx sees same child ghost from earlier. He is sitting watching his ghostly dad board a ghostly ship. Before he boards he kneels down and puts a ghostly helmet his child's head. The ship fades away, and [[Nyx Smoak]] watches as the child trip and drop the helmet into the water.

[[Nyx Smoak]] is compelled to help the child and runs towards the end of the pier and lets out a scream. She realizes that there is nothing she can do, and explains to the bluecoats that have gathered that she was reminded a painful memory of about a boy that fell off that pier and died many years ago. [[Sid Sage]] says the payment was 7 coins, and the Sgt. presses said he asked for 8. Sid agrees to pay the extra coin out of his own pocket, bluffing because the payment was actually 8 coins.

The Talons load up the cargo and haul it off. The crew meets Ninefingers at the Sanctuary. Ninefingers calls out [[Chantry Brikk]] for being an ex-bluecoat, and questions his intentions. Everyone comes to his defense, and [[Nyx Smoak]] summons a spirit which scares off some of the Knotwork crew but also injures Nyx during the attunement. After some dialogue Ninefingers hands over the [[Sanctuary]] and leaves with his crew.

The Nightshades head down to the [[Sanctuary]] and [[Nyx Smoak]] attunes to [[The Custodians]]. [[Chantry Brikk]] starts levitating, as he is picked up by green spirt arms. [[Nyx Smoak]] pleads for them keep him safe. A portal opens at the front of the room and drags [[Chantry Brikk]] in. [[Sid Sage]] grabs on and tries to pull him back, but fails and gets pulled into the portal. [[Nyx Smoak]] willingly jumps through the portal after them.

[[Teal Templeton]] investigates something underneath one of the benches, and looks up to realize that everyone is gone. He slowly walks up to the portal cautiously, thinking nothing of it. He goes to a nearby skeleton and checks for anything suspicious, finding nothing there as well. He places [[Chantry Brikk]]'s hat on the skeleton. He walks back to the middle of the room, holds his nose shut, and leaps through the portal.

The nightshades find themselves in a forest, and there is no sign of a portal back. [[Nyx Smoak]] asks why it brought us here, and it responded "Future". The crew spots a building in the distance. [[Teal Templeton]] is mysteriously missing.
